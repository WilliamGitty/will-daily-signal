Builds index.html for Will's Daily Signal from live RSS feeds.

Adapted from Oxford Edge's/Manoj's Daily Briefing pattern (see
agilisys-build-methodology.md in the Babyzone project folder for the wider
pattern family) - a personal daily digest: W12/West London property and
first-time-buyer policy news (the main interest), plus Scott Galloway,
West Ham, and AI/tech news.

No LLM involvement: every headline/summary/link comes verbatim from the
feed's own <title>/<description>/<link>, filtered by the feed's own
published/updated timestamp. This avoids the hallucinated-URL failure mode
of asking an LLM to "search the web" and report back.
